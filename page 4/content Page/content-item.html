		<h1>WECOME TO HEART CARE AT MEDICO</h1>
		<p>Bones and joints are crucial components of the human skeletal system, 
		providing support, protection, and mobility. Bones are hard, mineralized 
		tissues that form the framework of the body, protecting vital organs and 
		enabling movement. Joints, on the other hand, are the points where bones connect, 
		allowing for smooth movement and flexibility. The bones and joints work together 
		to support the body's weight, facilitate movement, and protect the internal organs. 
		Conditions affecting bones and joints, such as osteoporosis, arthritis, and fractures, 
		can significantly impact a person's quality of life and mobility. Proper care and treatment 
		are essential for maintaining bone and joint health, preventing injuries, and managing existing conditions.</p>
