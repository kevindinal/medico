		<h1>WECOME TO HEART CARE AT MEDICO</h1>
		<p>Eye care is a specialized field focused on the diagnosis, treatment,
		and management of conditions affecting the eyes. It includes a wide range
		of services, from routine eye exams to the treatment of specific eye diseases and 
		conditions. Eye care professionals, such as optometrists and ophthalmologists, provide 
		services to maintain eye health, prevent vision loss, and improve eye function. This 
		can involve the use of various diagnostic tools, prescription of corrective lenses, and 
		treatment for conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration. The ultimate 
		goal of eye care is to ensure clear, healthy vision and to prevent or treat vision-related problems.</p>
